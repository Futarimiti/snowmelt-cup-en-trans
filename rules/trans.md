### Number of contestants: 48

### Formal rules

1.  During the event,
    contestants will be divided into 3 divisions:
    Speed (S), Technical (T) and Complicated Beats (Cb).
    Songs will be classified
    into 3 categories correspondingly,
    namely class songs.

    An explanation of 3 song categories:
    | Category          | What to expect  <!-- ugh... -->                                               |
    | --                | --                                                                            |
    | Speed             | Charts testing the ability to cope with high-speed note patterns              |
    | Technical         | Charts testing positioning and the ability to cope with complex note patterns |
    | Complicated Beats | Charts testing the ability to cope with complex rhythm                       |

    The specific allocation of the songs  <!-- or 'charts'? -->
    will be announced at the time of application.

2.  Contestants will only compete with each other
    within their own division,
    using songs of their own division,
    and may only ban/pick songs of their own division.
    Part of the songs may be classified into multiple categories.

3.  Audition

    Contestants may freely choose their desired division
    during application,
    by which 3 class songs for each category will be published.
    Once decided, the contestants will need to play through the chosen class songs in a stretch,
    and submit the handcam and the screenshots of all 3 play results.
    Retrying, re-recording and editting the handcam are forbidden.  <!-- should we emphasise that pausing is allowed ? -->
    One may also switch to another division before the deadline.
    If so, the contestant should inform one of the staff about the change,
    and go through the same procedure once more as above,
    using the new choice of songs.  <!-- verbose -->

    At the end of the audition,
    contestants will be ranked
    according to their points on the 3 class songs.
    **In case of division A having > 16 contestants
    AND B with < 16,
    the prospective contestants eliminated from A
    will be given the opportunity to switch to B,
    but with a ranking certainly lower than
    anyone else originally placed there.**
    Contestants who decide to switch
    will need to go through the same
    audition procedure as aforementioned,
    and those ranked lower than 16 still will be eliminated
    once for all.  <!-- bad word choice -->
    (Note: contestants who switch divisions
    still need to possess the required songs
    as stated in the Application requirements.)

    Otherwise, in the case of
    all the divisions having ≥ 16 contestants,
    those ranked lower than 16 will be eliminated.
    Contestants who passed will then be examined for
    possessing the required songs.
    Contestants also need to bind with Bot
    using their Arcaea friend code.
    Anyone not possessing the required songs
    will be disqualified and being
    replaced by a previously eliminated
    contestant in the division,
    in the order of ranking.

4.  Round I: Group Stage, 16 into 8

    Within the same division,
    contestants will be arranged into *groups* of 4.
    With in each group,  <!-- verbose -->
    the judge will randomly select
    *6 non-repeating songs*
    from the pool in the relevant division
    for the upcoming matches.
    Before the matches begins,
    both competing contestants
    may DM the judge to pick one and only one song,
    to increase its chance of being selected
    in their participating round by 25%,
    AND/OR ban one and only one song.
    A pick and a ban cancel each other out
    when placed on the same song.
    The song picked/banned must be within
    the pool of the corresponding division.
    Contestants may not make changes to their choices later.

    The final ranking of each members in the group will be determined  <!-- how? -->
    when all the matches in the group are finished.
    The top 2 contestants will advance to the next round.

    Grouping of contestants is decided
    by the rankings of the audition
    (e.g. contestants ranked 1, 5, 9, 13
    are grouped together).

    The songs with fixed number 9.3--10.9
    are in the range of the selection for this round.

5.  Round II: Individual matches, 8 into 4

    Every champion from the last group stage
    will be grouped with a runner-up
    from a different group for a match.

    Process: Each contestant bans 3 songs →
    the judge announces the banned songs →
    each contestant picks 2 songs + the judge picks 1 song by random = 5 songs in total.
    The contestant with the higher points advances to the next round.
    (Ban/Pick must be done half an hour before the match)

    Special rule: After the pick is done,
    a contestant may DM the judge with "high" or "low"
    to have information about
    the approximate fix number of the opponent's pick
    (±0.1).

    The songs with fixed number 9.7--11.5
    are in the range of the selection for this round.

6.  Round III: Comeback <!-- expect better substitutes --> matches & Finals

    Comeback matches: 4 eliminated contestants
    from Round II will rematch to yield the top 2
    (ranked 5th and 6th).

    Process: Same as Round I,
    but without picking songs,
    and the number of songs reduced to 3.
    The range of the songs stays the same as Round II.

    Finals: 4 winning contestants from Round II
    are ranked from 1st to 4th place
    according to their points.

    Contestants placed 5th and 6th, the offensive,
    will need to each challenge any
    one of the top 4 contestants, the defensive.
    The 5th place contestant will be prioritised to make the decision.

    Part 1:

    1.  If either the 1st or 2nd place contestant is challenged:
        if the challenger wins,
        then two contestants swap places.
        Else if the challenged wins, the challenger is eliminated.

    2.  If either the the 3rd or 4th place contestant is challenged:
        if the challenger wins,
        then two contestants swap places,
        and the challenged is eliminated.
        Else if the challenged wins, the challenger is eliminated.

    Part 2:

    1.  If there are still 6 contestants left after Part 1,
        then the 5th and 6th place contestants must each challenge
        one of the 3rd or 4th place contestants,
        following the same rules as Part 1.

    2.  After the challenge, the 3rd and 4th place contestants
        must challenge one of the 1st or 2nd place contestants.
        The winning contestant will enter the champion match,
        and the losing contestant will contend for the
        second and third runner-up.
        The procedure and special rules of which
        are the same as Round II,
        except two more random songs are added
        to the pool in the champion match.

    The songs with fixed number 10.5--12.0
    are in the range of the selection for this round.

### Scoring  <!-- help me, LaTeX! -->

Note: "score" is your in-game play result,
while "points" is the score you get in the tournament,
which is derived from your play result.
"Scoring" is the procedure of calculating the points.

#### Single song scoring

    Points = (Maxpure*1 + Pure*0.9 + Far*0.2) / Note no.

#### Bonus

Bonus conditions are division-dependent (see below).
Once triggered, an alternative scoring formula
will be used in place.  <!-- ...as to include the bonus. -->

Division S: require (my score - opponent score ≥ 10,000)

    Points = (Maxpure*1 + Pure*0.96 + Far*0.2) / Note no.

Division T: require (my no. of Lost ≤ opponent's no. of Lost)

    Points = (Maxpure*1 + Pure*0.9 + Far*0.5) / Note no.

<!-- "小p"能直接翻成Pure吗 -->

Division Cb: require (my Pure no. - opponent Pure no. ≥ 10 AND my score ≥ 9,970,000)

    Points = (Maxpure*1 + Pure*0.9 + Far*0.2 + Lost*0.75) / Note no.

#### Overtime penalty

    Overtime-penalty(song) = Points(song) * (1-(Overtime-in-seconds^2 / 3600))

#### Audition scoring

Audition points summarise the single song points
for all three class songs.

#### Time allocation

*   Upon confirming the grouping,
    contestants should reach out to their opponents
    in order to determine the schedule of matches
    and duly notify the judge.

*   Should a contestant wish to Ban/Pick,
    they need to notify the judge at least 30 minutes
    prior to the starting of the match.

*   During the group stage (Round I),
    every match will commence 1 minute
    after announcing the song.
    5 minutes will be given for the music play,
    during which the contestant may restart the song if wished to.
    Contestants will then be given 4 minutes for
    a moment of respite.
    Matches maybe be separated  <!-- how about "asynchronous"? -->
    if scheduled, but it is recommended 
    for players within the same group 
    to finish up soon whenever possible,
    for the convenience of statistics.  <!-- feels weird man -->

*   Play song/rest time allocation during
    the individual matches (Round II) will be the
    same as in Round I.

#### Handcams & screenshots

Handcam is required throughout the tournament.
The recording must remain unedited 
and include accurate timestamping (down to the second)
at both the beginning and end of the music play,
based on Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).

Please make sure to capture a timestamped screenshot
of the play result
at the end of the music play.
In case of the player being mistakenly ruled overtime,
the screenshot/handcam could be
submitted as evidence for the judges to review.

Only the winning contestant needs to submit the handcam
at the end of the match.  <!-- team? -->

Exception: one who retries a song
for **no more than once** would
**never** trigger the overtime penalty
regardless of whether the timeout occurs.
Please appeal to the staff team
in case of wrongful overtime penalty.  <!-- need better wording -->

#### Ban/Pick

*   Ban: Disable a song from appearing in the current round.

*   Pick: Choose a song to make it definitely 
    appearing in the current round.  <!-- "unless otherwise stated" -->

*   During the group stage (Round I), 
    banned and picked song will be revealed
    at the end of the round.
    *   Note: repeated picks on one
        song will be considered as one pick only.

*   During the individual matches (Round II),
    the banned song will be announced
    before the commencement.
    Contestants will not be permitted
    to pick a banned song. 
    Picked songs will be revealed at the end of the round.
    *   Note: repeated picks on one
        song will be considered as one pick only,
        and a random song,
        guaranteed not to be
        overlapping with the pick songs,
        will kick in.  <!-- informal -->
