## Snowmelt Cup II

### Eternal Blue & Mysterious Fortune

Stretches afar zenith the sapphire, lingers adrift the melting snow.

Beneath the firmament interconnecting the past and the future,
we so converged, so conversed, and so contended.
To bring more bright smiles on
the faces of all the enthusiastic fighters of Arcaea,
You, the indispensable part of Us,
are herein sincerely welcomed
to showcase your skills and delight the upcoming Snowmelt Cup II.

The event will be scheduled
over separate weekends commencing August 2023.
Registration will take form of subject tracks,
3 of which may be individually decided,
as per their flair,
by each player to be taken into compete.  <!-- too complex! -->
Generous prizes await the winners!

With this opportunity, we hope to provide a platform for
the worldwide contestants to exchange experience,
improve skills, build relationships,
and most importantly, enjoy the event.

<!-- pursuing not only their individual quests, but also the essence of pursuit itself.
"individual quests"好奇怪但是我实在不会翻“所追寻之物”.."what they pursue"又好像有点重复

there's literally no way to properly translate this without introducing confusions
I suggest just cutting this part out

At last, please allow us to express our sincere
gratitude and honour at your presence.
Snowmelt Cup will shine her every glow with your participation,
and keep her everlasting joy and memories
in the heart of every Arcaea player
