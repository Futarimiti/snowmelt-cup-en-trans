## Snowmelt Cup II

### Eternal Blue & Mysterious Fortune

Stretches afar zenith the sapphire, lingers adrift the melting snow.

Under the firmament interconnecting the past and the future,
we so converged, so conversed, and so contended.
We hope to bring bright smiles to
all enthusiastic fighters of Arcaea,  <!-- ugh, bit of sudden? -->
and You, are the indispensable part of Us.  <!-- 感觉上这句和上一句接着好点？上一句也不会很突兀 -->
Here, we sincerely welcome the community of ARCAEA players
to showcase your skills and bring delights to the Snowmelt Cup II.  <!-- try to be more literary -->
<!-- "here" 和 "players"有待改进，最后一句可以删掉一半。-->

The event of Snowmelt Cup II will be held
over separate weekends commencing August 2023.
Registration will take form of subject tracks,
3 of which may be decided individually
according to the competence of each player
to be taken into compete.  <!-- too much "compete"! -->
Generous prizes await the winners!

In this event, we hope to provide a platform for
worldwide contestants to exchange experience,
improve skills, share joy, build relationships,
<!-- pursuing not only their individual quests, 
but also the essence of pursuit itself. --> <!-- "individual quests"好奇怪但是我实在不会翻“所追寻之物”.."what they pursue"又好像有点重复 -->
and pursue the meaning of the pursuit itself.  <!-- sounds weird but meh -->

At last, please allow us to express our sincere
gratitude and honour at your presence.
Snowmelt Cup will shine her every glow with your participation,
and keep her everlasting joy and satisfaction  <!-- "satisfaction" does not sound right; maybe "memories" --> <!-- 正确的 -->
in the heart of every Arcaea player
bravely stepping into the challenge.
