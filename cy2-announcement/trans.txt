Important Notice:
We would like to make some clarifications about the situation related to CytusII collaboration. 
1. In order not to take up the time for players to play new songs, the audition will start one day earlier (that is 12 noon on 7.15)
2. CytusII collaboration songs will not appear in the competition (they will not be randomized and no picks will be allowed), and the pool of songs will remain unchanged.
